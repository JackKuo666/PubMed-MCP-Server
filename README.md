# PubMed MCP Server

🔍 Enable AI assistants to search, access, and analyze PubMed articles through a simple MCP interface.

The PubMed MCP Server provides a bridge between AI assistants and PubMed's vast repository of biomedical literature through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows AI models to search for scientific articles, access their metadata, and perform deep analysis in a programmatic way.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- FastMCP library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JackKuo666/PubMed-MCP-Server.git
   cd PubMed-MCP-Server
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

## 📊 Usage

Start the MCP server:

```bash
python pubmed_server.py
```

## 🛠 MCP Tools

The PubMed MCP Server provides the following tools:

1. `search_pubmed_key_words`: Search for articles on PubMed using keywords.
2. `search_pubmed_advanced`: Perform an advanced search for articles on PubMed with multiple parameters.
3. `get_pubmed_article_metadata`: Fetch metadata for a PubMed article using its PMID.
4. `download_pubmed_pdf`: Attempt to download the full-text PDF for a PubMed article.
5. `deep_paper_analysis`: Perform a comprehensive analysis of a PubMed article.

### Searching Papers

You can ask the AI assistant to search for papers using queries like:
```
Can you search PubMed for recent papers about CRISPR?
```

### Getting Paper Details

Once you have a PMID, you can ask for more details:
```
Can you show me the metadata for the paper with PMID 12345678?
```

### Analyzing Papers

You can request a deep analysis of a paper:
```
Can you perform a deep analysis of the paper with PMID 12345678?
```
